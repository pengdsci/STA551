<h3>1. Objectives</h3>
    
The objective of this project is to put together some of the topics we learned this semester to work on real-world problems. 
 
<b>The data management part</b> aims to create an analytic data set that has enough information for exploring the potential association between preference of the political party and unemployment, poverty level, education level, and estimated income using the US county-level data. 
    
<h3>2. Data Sources </h3>
The involved data sets can be found in the following.
    <ul>
        <li> Presidential Election Data <a href="https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/countypresidential_election_2000-2020.csv" target="popup"         onclick="window.open('https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/countypresidential_election_2000-2020.csv','name','width=900,height=500')">
        [countypresidential_election_2000-2020.csv] </a> </li>
        
        <li> Unemployment Data <a href="https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/Unemployment.csv" target="popup"  onclick="window.open('https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/Unemployment.csv','name','width=900,height=500')">[Unemployment.csv]</a> </li>

        <li> Poverty Data <a href="https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/PovertyEstimates.csv" target="popup" 
        onclick="https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/PovertyEstimates.csv','name','width=900,height=500')">
        [PovertyEstimates.csv]</a> </li>
        
        <li> Education Data <a href="https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/Education.csv" target="popup"         onclick="window.open('https://pengdsci.github.io/datasets/Education.csv','name','width=900,height=500')">
        [Education.csv] </a> </li>  
     </ul>
 
<h3>3. Specific Requirements of Data Preparation</h3>
 The information to be included in the analytic data set is outlined in the following. 
 <ul>    
   <li> <b>Presidential Election Data</b>: The following information should be kept
       <ul>
           <li> only use the 2020 election data</li>
           <li> only keep the data for the two major parties: Democrats and Republicans</li>
           <li> aggregate the <b>total</b> votes and <b>keep the winning party</b> in the data</li>
           <li> county FIPS code, State name, county name, total votes received in the winning party, and the name of the party </li>
       </ul>
       
   <li><b>Unemployment Data</b>: The following information should be kept in the data </li>
     <ul>
       <li>Only keep the unemployment date in the year 2000 or the most recent year in which the unemployment rate is available</li>
       <li>County FIPS code</li>
       <li>Unemployment rate</li>
     </ul>
  
     <li><b>Poverty Data</b>: The following information should be kept in the data</li>
     <ul>
       <li>Keep only 2019 poverty rate [the variable name in the data set: PCTPOVALL_2019]</li>
       <li>County FIPS code</li>
     </ul>
     
     <li><b>Education Data</b>: The following information should be kept in the data</li>
     <ul>
       <li>only keep the percentage of education levels between 2015 and 2019.</li>
       <li>Education levels</li>
         <ul>
         <li> less than a high school diploma</li>
         <li> high school diploma</li>
         <li> completed some college (1-3 years)</li>
         <li> completed four years of college</li>
         </ul>
        <li>County FIPS code </li>
     </ul>
    </ul>   

    After finishing managing the above <i>relational </i>data sets, combine them to create a single data set in which each county has only one record.
    
 <h3>4. Summarizing Data with SAS Graphics</h3>   
    
  Create some SAS graphics to summarize a few selected variables in the final combined analytic data set. I will not specify which variables you should select and what SAS graphics you should use. It is totally dependent on which variables you are interested in examining further.
    
 <h3>5. Some Suggestions on Coding Conventions</h3>
 
 The following are some suggestions on best practices in coding projects with multiple tasks. 
  <ul>
    <li><b>Formatting</b>: A good programmer should write code in ways that make review as easy to read as
possible. Good formatting of the code is essential.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Putting multiple statements on one line hurts readability</li>
      <li>When having a list of variables, put each variable on its own line</li>
      <li>all the statements in a data step or proc step should be indented except for the first and last one.</li>
      <li>Include the “run” or “quit” statements at the end of all statements.</li>
      </ul>
      
    <li><b>Commenting</b>: Commenting makes the code more readable and understandable. It should be used in your code appropriately. The following are a few occasions a comment should be used. </li>
      <ul>
          <li> A <i>program header</i> that contains a comment code that lists information about the program. </li>
          <li> When making a change to the code, commenting should be made appropriately</li>
          <li> When a code line or code block involves your smart idea that is not obvious to others, you need a comment on it. </li>
      </ul>
      
     <li><b>Naming Conventions</b>: Using the naming conventions in SAS code.</li> 
      <ul>
      <li>Dataset names should describe as best as possible what is in the dataset</li>
      <li>The key to choosing variable names is clarity. Variable names can be up to 32 characters long in SAS.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
    
   <h3>6. Requirement for This Specific Project</h3> 
    
   The following two specific requirements for this project will help save me time when I review and test-run your code. 
    
    <ul>
    <li>Read all data sets <b>directly from the given URLs</b></li>
    <li>Store all temporary data sets in the SAS temporary library. That is, you are expected not to save any temporary data sets in any permanent SAS libraries.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this coding project.
